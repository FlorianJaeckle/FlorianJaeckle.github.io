# About

I am a final year PhD Student at the University of Oxford where I a member of the Optimization for Vision and Learning (OVAL) group in the Department of Engineering Science. 

The focus of my PhD lies on improving optimization algorithms with Machine Learning and Graph Neural Networks. In particular, I have worked on Neural Network Verification, Adversarial Attacks, and now Data Poisoning.

Prior to my PhD I completed my Bachelors and Masterâ€™s in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
